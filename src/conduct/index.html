            <b>Rules and Guidelines</b>
            <br />
            Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and
            passions. These rules are in place so that everyone can feel
            comfortable participating in C2C. If you think they need editing or
            don’t cover something important, please let us know at &nbsp;<a

            <b>Strict Rules</b>
            <br />
            These are the rules/the things this space is not for. We tried to
            keep them short, with more in-depth explanations in the appendix.
            Breaking any of these will result in your prompt removal from C2C.
            <ul>
              <li>No harassment, including personal attacks.</li>
              <li>
                No spam. If Gmail wouldn’t put it in my inbox, it shouldn’t be
                in C2C. This includes doing attention-catching things like
                writing in all caps, using clickbait headlines, or otherwise
                editing the post or preview to pop out at the cost of other
                posts. Posts not relating to hackathons or tech will also be
                considered spam.
              </li>
              <li>No shitposting, bad programmer jokes, or memes.</li>
              <li>
                No recruiting for your startup, company, job, or organization.
              </li>
              <li>
                No posting requests or giveaways for free stuff/invites. Those
                belong in Code2Create.
              </li>
              <li>
                No illegal/pirated content, requests for it, or information
                regarding the distribution of it.
              </li>
              <li>
                No telling people they or their post is not welcome in Code 2
                Create. If you think a post does not belong in C2C, report the
                post or message an admin. If you make other people feel
                unwelcome in C2C, we will remove you from the group.

            <b>Inclusivity Statement</b>
            <br />
            Code 2 Create is the all-inclusive hackathons community.
            <br />
            We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a
            community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat
            everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a
            participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take
            responsibility for it.
            <br />
            Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor
            diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture,
            ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession,
            race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and
            technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any
            of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
            disabilities. There is no one true hacker.
            <br />
            Our community prioritizes marginalized people’s safe existence in
            the community. We will not tolerate posts encouraging:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Insensitivity toward boundary statements, such as “leave me
                alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
              </li>
              <li>
                Racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviors or
                assumptions (although these discussions may be moved to
                organising committee debate if they better fit its guidelines)
              </li>
            </ul>
            However, if you have a post that falls in the above categories yet
            you feel still belongs in C2C, you can message a moderator to
            discuss it. We’ve had posts like these in the past that turned into
            constructive discussions with a bit of reframing. Talking about hard
            problems is, itself, hard.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>[serious] tag</b>
            <br />
            To encourage a more serious discussion on your post, you may preface
            it with a [serious] tag. Posts with the serious tag as well as their
            comments
            <ul>
              <li>Must be on topic</li>
              <li>Must NOT give intentionally misleading advice</li>
              <li>
                Must NOT be images/memes unless relevant or asked for in the
                original post
              </li>
              <li>
                Must NOT be single words or phrases without explanation.
